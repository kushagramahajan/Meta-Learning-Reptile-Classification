# Meta-Learning-Reptile-Classification

[Reptile](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02999) training code for [ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/).

Reptile is a meta-learning algorithm that finds a good initialization. It works by sampling a task, training on the sampled task, and then updating the initialization towards the new weights for the task.
